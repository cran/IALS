Description: The matrix factor model has drawn growing attention for its advantage in achieving two-directional dimension reduction simultaneously for matrix-structured observations. In contrast to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based methods, we propose a simple Iterative Alternating Least Squares (IALS) algorithm for matrix factor models, see the details in He et al. (2023) <arXiv:2301.00360>.
